  i. The purpose of this project is to create a Hash Table that will be used by my assembler (Pass One and Pass Two) 
  
  ii. ProjectOne.java file: implementation of the program
  Data.java file: contains the ArrayList class
  
  iii. input.txt file: Consists of strings (with and without numbers).
  Ones without numbers: searched for in the array.
  Ones with numbers: assigned a spot in the array.

  iv. Honya.txt file: output file that is generated from the placement of the strings (using the input file).
  If an error occured, it will be printed in the file.
